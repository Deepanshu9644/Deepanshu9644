## Hi there 👋

I'm Deepanshu Kumar, a passionate and goal-driven Full Stack Java Developer from India.

I bring a strong foundation in Java, C, and core web technologies, complemented by hands-on experience with Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL, and modern tools like Firebase, VAPI, and the Gemini API. With a deep understanding of Object-Oriented Programming, RESTful API development, and secure authentication, I thrive in building scalable backend systems and integrating smart AI-driven solutions.

🚀 My projects like InterviewGenie (an AI-powered mock interview platform) and MailMinds (a smart email reply Chrome extension) demonstrate my ability to combine backend architecture with cutting-edge APIs to solve real-world problems.
📈 With over 400+ LeetCode problems solved and a 5⭐ Java badge on HackerRank, I continuously sharpen my DSA and system design skills to stay ahead.
🎯 I actively participate in hackathons like Smart India Hackathon and GFG Hackathon, where I collaborate with teams to bring ideas to life under pressure.

I'm always open to collaborating on innovative software products and contributing to impactful tech communities.
